<p>When I was in middle school I got in a fight w my friend abt whether or not this was weird. I was like “why are they knocking their heads against each other like that” and then my friend was like they’re fucking cuddling freak. When I got in a relationship later and nuzzled my partners face for the first time I felt like a fucking virgin for criticizing these women who had already been through so much</p></blockquote>
