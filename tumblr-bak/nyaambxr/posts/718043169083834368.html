And then you&rsquo;ve got to marry her like I did.&rdquo;</p><p>this was a very smart woman who played dumb professionally. this was a man who adored his wife, and respected the hell out of her as a working partner. this is the analogy that&rsquo;s being drawn here. </p><p>what I&rsquo;m saying is that this two-word line is so, so important. <strike>and anyone who thinks caroline is stupid should be pushed out a window</strike> </p></blockquote>
