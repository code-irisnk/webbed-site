      <p>Having internet friends is an experience. Did you eat today? I can&rsquo;t believe your sister hasn&rsquo;t apologized yet, what a bitch. Drink a glass of water right now. Want to see a cat picture? I love you. I know you better than your parents. I don&rsquo;t know your name. I&rsquo;m having a rough day, can you talk to me about your favorite videogame? I love you. Good morning means good night means good afternoon means go to sleep. Here&rsquo;s a doodle I made in class. I&rsquo;m stealing your clothes as we speak, they&rsquo;re so pretty. I love you. I love your pet. What does your hair look like? I&rsquo;d love to see that weird leaf. I love you. I&rsquo;m making you your favorite food. Thank you for holding my secrets for me. I love you. We&rsquo;re having a coffee date. I love you. I&rsquo;m giving you a screen-sized hug. I love you. I love you. I love you. </p>
