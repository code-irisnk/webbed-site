## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. Contact me via email at [irisnk@elrant.team](mailto:irisnk@elrant.team) using encrypted (PGP) and signed (S/MIME) communication when possible.
2. Use the provided [PGP Key](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/29AAE731164AFE97A2E8ECA83FB89E8ADB3D4BFC) to encrypt sensitive information.
3. Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it and any relevant logs or evidence.
4. You can expect an initial response within 72 hours (or, well, whenever I'm free... or find someone to help me...) and updates on the investigation status as it progresses.
5. If the vulnerability is confirmed, I will coordinate a resolution and disclosure timeline with you.

Thank you for helping keep this weird silly website secure!
