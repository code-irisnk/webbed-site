              <p>No we don&rsquo;t. Respect ppls boundaries. If respect isn&rsquo;t normal anymore what will be normal then? Anything, no matter how it impacts or scars other peoples lives? Kink doesn&rsquo;t belongs to pride. </p>

            <h2><span class="npf_color_joey">Look around you. Do you see where “No Kink At Pride” has led? Being transgender is illegal now. Exactly what people said would happen. You know what’s going to be next? Being gay is going to be illegal. Because being gay is not “respecting straight people’s boundaries”. They don’t want to see you. They want to kill you.</span></h2>

          <p>In support of the OP, let me clue the reply poster in to some of how the worldview of conservative bigots works:</p>
          <p>If you are trans you are a sex pervert</p>
          <p>If you&rsquo;re gay you&rsquo;re a sex pervert.</p>
          <p>If you&rsquo;re the world&rsquo;s most chaste and godly nun praying in a convent, who has a lesbian thought <i>once</i> while delirious from a fever, you are a sex pervert.</p>
          <p>If you&rsquo;re a family with a white picket fence house, a breadwinner, a stay-at-home parent, two cars, a dog, and whose politics are right wing&hellip; if you happen to be a same-sex couple, you&rsquo;re sex perverts and probably pedophiles.</p>
          <p>If you&rsquo;re a closeted, self-hating, self-hurting, self-repressing queer going through every torturous form of conversion therapy, who condemns the other queers, who screams at the people who seek abortion help outside Planned Parenthood&hellip; you are a filthy, irredeemable sex pervert, a danger to children, and the most sympathy you deserve is transient pity if you admit to struggling.</p>
          <p>There is nothing you can do, no behaviour you can engage in, no thought you can have, no clothes you can wear, no existence you can lead that is not an unacceptable sex perversion in the minds of these people. <b><i>Your existence is kink</i></b>, and you cannot appease them into thinking otherwise.</p>
          <p>The bigoted conservative mind cannot conceive of queerness except as perversion, except as hedonistic degenerate thrill-seeking. They don&rsquo;t know another reason to do <i>any thing</i>, except as an exercise of power over someone else. Their entire world revolves around this idea. Everything is power, everything is control.</p>
          <p>Therefore you can never appease them. Your mere existence is to them a totalizing threat, to their worldview, to their sense of normalcy, to their positions of social power, to their patriarchy, to their holiness. The only thing you can do that will ever satisfy them is die.</p>
          <p>Which leaves us with this:</p>
          <p>Either we have solidarity with our queer siblings - <i>yes</i> including the ones you don&rsquo;t understand, <i>yes</i> including the ones who have that weird sex that you think is fucked up, <i>yes</i> including the cringe annoying ones who &ldquo;make the rest of us look bad,&rdquo; <i>yes</i> including the fucked up problematic ones who need to change and make amends, but who deserve their human rights whether or not they ever do that.</p>
          <p>Because to the bigot, to the conservative, you&rsquo;re every bit as much of a pervert as Jenny Piss Kink and their polycule of submissive puppy-masked gender sluts. You throw your bricks when they come for Jenny, because when they come for the Piss Puppy Polycule, <i>they&rsquo;re coming for you too.</i></p>

      <p>Also, to add as a historian, a queer, and a non-monogamous kinky bitch:</p>
      <p>Who, the actual fuck, do you think we got pride from??? Because I can fucking promise you it wasn&rsquo;t the Respectable Gays&trade; that threw bricks at Stonewall. It wasn&rsquo;t Respectable Gays who rioted. We have pride because of kinky fuckers. </p>
      <p>As a relationship coach:</p>
      <p>Boundaries are not &ldquo;you can not do this thing because it makes me uncomfortable.&rdquo; Boundaries are for *you*, *your behavior*, and what you will accept others doing *to you* before you remove yourself from the situation. Not something you use to control the behavior of others.</p>
      <p>Don&rsquo;t like someone wearing leather at pride? Then your boundary is not going to pride, not banning leather. </p>
